# Hi my name is Thom Bator. I am an aspiring Software Developer from Toronto, Canada.  

I'm currently in my final year of a B.Sc in Computer Science at Western Governors University. 
Before entering into my degree program I worked for about 10 years as an advertising copywriter and video script writer. 
I look forward to transitioning into a Software Developer role when I complete my studies in several months.
